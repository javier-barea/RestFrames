The example can be found in the **RestFrames** package at

    examples/example_DiStop_to_bXp_bXm_to_blNblN.C

You can run the compiled example executable:

    ./examples/example_DiStop_to_bXp_bXm_to_blNblN.x

or run the example from the ROOT interactive command line:

    root [0] .x examples/example_DiStop_to_bXp_bXm_to_blNblN.C+ //ROOT5
    root [0] .x examples/example_DiStop_to_bXp_bXm_to_blNblN.C  //ROOT6

For the latter, if **RestFrames** is not installed in an area in the
default `PATH` then you must first load the **RestFrames**
environmental variables with `source setup_RestFrames.(c)sh`. You can
find additional details about running **RestFrames** examples [here]({% post_url 2016-05-14-intro %}).
